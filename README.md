##Description Challemge 3:
Loop type chosen: nested for loops (outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns)  
Why that loop: A multiplication table is a two-dimensional grid. Nested loops fit well with rows and columns. The outer loop goes through the rows. For each row, the inner loop runs through the columns to produce that rowâ€™s products.
